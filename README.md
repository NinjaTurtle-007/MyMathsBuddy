## 💝 **A Note from the Creator**

Hi! I'm @ninjaturtle_007, a working mom and amateur developer.

I built this tool at 3 AM fueled by coffee and frustration - tired of hunting for worksheets, fighting with printers, and spending ₹500/month on photocopies.

If this tool saves even ONE parent from 11 PM panic mode, it was worth it! 

This isn't perfect. I'm not a teacher. But it works, it's free, and it's made with love for our kids' education.

Use it, share it, and may your printers never jam again! 🖨️✨

With love and solidarity,  
@ninjaturtle_007

P.S. - If you spot bugs or have ideas, hit me up! I'm learning as I go. 😊
